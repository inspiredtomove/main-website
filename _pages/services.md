      Meditation using the principles of iRest Yoga Nidra is based on the ancient practice
      of Yoga Nidra, and only requires you to relax and listen along. While very simple and
      easy to do, it is very effective. This practice invites us to investigate and explore
      emotions, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and images. Often times we can find a deeper
      understanding of ourselves, our challenges, and our relationships. For some people,
      wonderful revelations will be unveiled. For many, this practice can evoke happiness,
      joy, and even bliss.
