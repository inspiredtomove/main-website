      Pilates is a low-impact, mindful movement and thorough method of physical
      conditioning that delivers profound results. With a strong emphasis on body
      awareness, alignment, and breath, practicing Pilates will strengthen the mind-body
      connection. Muscle imbalances will be corrected while lengthening and
      strengthening muscles of the body. Benefits, such as improved strength, posture,
      coordination, flexibility, and balance, all contribute to improved movement
      efficiency and overall wellbeing. Pilates will help you to move well, and, as Joseph
      Pilates says, “naturally, easily, and satisfactorily performing their many and daily
      tasks….”. People of all ages and levels of physical ability are welcome.

    excerpt: >
      Essentrics is a low-impact, dynamic workout that simultaneously lengthens and
      strengthens every muscle in the body. It is a full-body technique that works through
      the muscle chains, liberating and empowering the muscles, relieving them from
      tension in the process. Essentrics draws on the flowing movements of tai chi, which
      creates health and balance, the strengthening theories behind ballet, which create
      long, lean, flexible muscles, and the healing principles of physiotherapy, which
      creates a pain free body. Benefits of Essentrics include improving posture, range of
      motion, flexibility, agility, and strength, while working to heal and prevent injuries.
      People of all ages and levels of physical ability are welcome.

    excerpt: >
      Meditation using the principles of iRest Yoga Nidra is based on the ancient practice
      of Yoga Nidra, and only requires you to relax and listen along. While very simple and
      easy to do, it is very effective. This practice invites us to investigate and explore
      emotions, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and images. Often times we can find a deeper
      understanding of ourselves, our challenges, and our relationships. For some people,
      wonderful revelations will be unveiled. For many, this practice can evoke happiness,
      joy, and even bliss.
