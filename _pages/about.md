Ashley has always liked to move. From a young age she was a competitive dancer and soccer player, and a dabbler in various outdoor activities.
She completed a Bachelors of Applied Science in Health Studies at the
University of Waterloo, and a Masters of Science, Epidemiology at the University of
Guelph in order to pursue what she believed would be her career.

In her early 20s, Ashley began experiencing chronic pain, primarily in her neck and
back, but as she got older, the pain became widespread, and often left her feeling
exhausted and unable to participate in her favourite activities. This pain persisted
and worsened throughout her 20s. In her early 30s, she experienced a devastating
loss when her beloved mother and uncle were killed in a car accident. Two years
later, her father died suddenly from an unknown medical condition. These
experiences resulted in a drastic increase in Ashley’s physical pain, as well as the
emotional pain of grief and anxiety.

These losses took a toll on Ashley’s wellbeing. Most days, even walking led to severe pain that left her feeling defeated, and
powerless. She also began experiencing anxiety, and regular, debilitating panic attacks. As a parent of three, Ashley often felt drained, empty, lonely, and fearful.

In a quest to regain her sense of wholeness, Ashley began a journey of healing. It
was this journey that led Ashley to start honouring the importance of listening to her body and responding to its needs. Ashley became interested in how her chronic pain and emotional
pain seemed to ebb and flow as a unit, and how the pairing of movement and meditation was an effective tool to support her health and wellbeing. Movement not only helped her chronic pain,
but also gave her reprieve from her grief and anxiety. Similarly, meditation not only helped her emotional
health and wellbeing, but also her physical pain. 

Ashley completed Mat and Standing Pilates certification through the PhysicalMind
Institute Canada, Level One Essentrics® certification through The Esmonde
Technique, Essentrics®, and Level One Meditation Teacher training (using the
principles of iRest Yoga Nidra) with the Internal Peace Initiative. She is also certified in Modified and Pre/Postnatal Pilates, and Bone Fit Trained. Anchored by the
philosophy that all bodies are good bodies, Ashley is passionate about sharing her
experiences in strengthening the mind-body connection, building strong
communities, and bringing mindful movement to every body.
