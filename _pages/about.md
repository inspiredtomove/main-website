Ashley has always liked to move. From a young age she was an avid dancer, a
competitive soccer player, and a dabbler in various outdoor activities.
While always an important part of who she was, Ashley always treated movement as
a hobby. She completed a Bachelors of Applied Science in Health Studies at the
University of Waterloo, and a Masters of Science, Epidemiology at the University of
Guelph in order to pursue what she believed would be her career.

In her early 20s, Ashley began experiencing chronic pain, primarily in her neck and
back, but as she got older, the pain became widespread, and often left her feeling
exhausted and unable to participate in her favourite activities. This pain persisted
and worsened throughout her 20s. In her early 30s, she experienced a devastating
loss when her beloved mother and uncle were killed in a car accident. Two years
after that, her father died suddenly from an unknown medical condition. These
experiences resulted in a drastic increase in Ashley’s physical pain, as well as the
emotional pain of grief and anxiety.

These losses took a toll on Ashley’s wellbeing. She found herself in so much pain,
that most days even walking led to severe pain that left her feeling defeated, and
powerless. She also began experiencing regular, debilitating panic attacks and
anxiety. As a parent of three, Ashley often felt drained, empty, lonely, and fearful.

In a quest to regain her sense of wholeness, Ashley began a journey of healing. It
was through this journey that Ashley realized that choosing appropriate movement
for her body not only helped her chronic pain, but also gave her reprieve from her
grief and anxiety. Movement took her out of her head, and put her inside of her
body. Ashley learned to better listen to her body’s needs, and started avoiding
physical activities that while fun, were harmful to her health and wellbeing. During
this time, Ashley became really interested in how her chronic pain and emotional
pain seemed to ebb and flow as a unit. Movement not only helped her chronic pain,
but also her grief and anxiety. Similarly, meditation not only helped her mental
health, but also her physical pain.

Ashley completed Mat and Standing Pilates certification through the PhysicalMind
Institute Canada, Level One Essentrics® certification through The Esmonde
Technique, Essentrics®, and Level One Meditation Teacher training (using the
principles of iRest Yoga Nidra) with the Internal Peace Initiative. Anchored by the
philosophy that all bodies are good bodies, Ashley is passionate about sharing her
experiences in strengthening the mind-body connection, building strong
communities, and bringing mindful movement to every body.
