        As a physiotherapist I would highly recommend essentrics to people. **-- Parise**

      > She gave great feedback throughout the class, as well
        as subtle reminders about body position at just the right times throughout. It was
        such a great feeling afterwards. I discovered muscles I didn't even realize I had! **-- David**

Essentrics is a low-impact, dynamic, full body movement that simultaneously strengthens and lengthens all 650 muscles of the body. Itâ€™s based on the principles of tai chi, which creates health and balance, the strengthening theories behind ballet, which creates long, lean, flexible muscles, and the healing principles of physiotherapy, which creates a pain-free body.
