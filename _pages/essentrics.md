        As a physiotherapist I would highly recommend essentrics to people. **-- Parise**

      > She gave great feedback throughout the class, as well
        as subtle reminders about body position at just the right times throughout. It was
        such a great feeling afterwards. I discovered muscles I didn't even realize I had! **-- David**
