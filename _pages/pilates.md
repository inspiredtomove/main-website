      > As a
        true beginner, I found it to be a very approachable experience. I enjoyed our session,
        and felt inspired to learn and grow more. She has a calming demeanour, and a very
        high level of knowledge. She did an excellent job explaining the fundamentals, but
        made sure to explain how the skills would be grown in the future. 
        Regardless of your fitness level, or experience with Pilates, I highly recommend
        trying a class with Ashley. **-- Jill**

Pilates is a low-impact, mindful movement, and full-body method of physical conditioning. Perfect for men and women of all fitness levels, this program has a strong emphasis on body awareness, alignment, and breath. A regular Pilates practice will strengthen the mind-body connection. Benefits, such as improved strength, mobility, coordination, balance, and correction of muscle imbalances, all contribute to improved movement efficiency and overall wellbeing.

> Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. Our interpretation of physical fitness is the attainment and maintenance of a uniformly developed body with a sound mind fully capable of naturally, easily, and satisfactorily performing our many and varied daily tasks with spontaneous zest and pleasure.
