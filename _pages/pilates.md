      > As a
        true beginner, I found it to be a very approachable experience. I enjoyed our session,
        and felt inspired to learn and grow more. She has a calming demeanour, and a very
        high level of knowledge. She did an excellent job explaining the fundamentals, but
        made sure to explain how the skills would be grown in the future. 
        Regardless of your fitness level, or experience with Pilates, I highly recommend
        trying a class with Ashley. **-- Jill**

Pilates is a low-impact, mindful movement and thorough method of physical
conditioning that delivers profound results. With a strong emphasis on body
awareness, alignment, and breath, practicing Pilates will strengthen the mind-body
connection. Muscle imbalances will be corrected while lengthening and
strengthening muscles of the body. Benefits, such as improved strength, posture,
coordination, flexibility, and balance, all contribute to improved movement
efficiency and overall wellbeing. People of all ages and levels of physical ability are welcome.

> Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. Our interpretation of physical fitness is the attainment and maintenance of a uniformly developed body with a sound mind fully capable of naturally, easily, and satisfactorily performing our many and varied daily tasks with spontaneous zest and pleasure.
