      > The level of professionalism and compassion were incredible. She was easy to follow, offered modifications, and was extremely encouraging to two post partum moms who have put their fitness on the back burner lately. **-- Jenn**

## Movement Education
  - Offer low-impact movement practices through Pilates and Essentrics
  - Encourage increased knowledge and awareness of healthy movement, both
on and off the mat through the use of mindfulness and self-inquiry
  - Classes available for all ages and levels of physical ability

## Empowerment by Increasing the Mind-Body Connection
  - We believe in the interrelationship between our mind and body, that our
thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can affect how healthy our body is,
and that our physical body can impact our mental health.
  - We encourage listening and responding to the needs of our bodies, minds,
and hearts
  - We offer meditation using the principles of iRest Yoga Nidra that allows
individuals to connect more deeply with themselves
  - Movement classes encourage an inner focus, and a monitoring of the
thoughts, feelings, and emotions that emerge

## Body Positive and Self Love
  - We aim to create a space where all bodies are welcomed, accepted, and
celebrated
  - We aim to create movement classes that have your desired level of physical
challenge, while offering yourself kindness and compassion
  - We aim to create a space where the value and worth of every individual is
celebrated, regardless of physical abilities or appearance(?)

## Celebrating Diversity
  - Welcoming of all genders and identities (listed somehow with the Oxford
Rainbow Coalition?)
  - Mental health and trauma…….. (trauma aware environment)?
  - Hands-on adjustment cards (Queen Street Yoga) – clearly and discreetly
indicate preference for hands-on adjustments
  - We aim to co-create inclusive, diverse spaces that support both individual
and community growth and change
