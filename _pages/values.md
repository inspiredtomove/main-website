## Joyful Movement
- We promote movement as a discovery process, encouraging mindfulness and self-inquiry
- We teach process-oriented, low-impact movement classes available for all ages and levels of physical ability

## Mind-Body Connection
- We believe there is an interrelationship between mind and body, and both are important for well-being
- We encourage listening and responding to the needs our bodies, minds, and hearts
- We encourage an inner focus, and monitoring of thoughts, feelings, and emotions

## Body Positive
- We believe all bodies are welcomed, accepted, and celebrated
- We believe self-compassion is encouraged during physical challenges
- We believe our self-worth is not dependent on our physical ability or appearance
